Updating dependencies
Your requirements 
could not be resolved 
to an installable set 
of packages.

  Problem 1
    - 
laravel/framework is 
locked to version 
v11.48.0 and an update 
of this package was 
not requested.
    - 
laravel/framework 
v11.48.0 requires 
league/flysystem-local 
^3.25.1 -> satisfiable 
by league/flysystem-loc
al[3.31.0].
    - 
league/flysystem-local 
3.31.0 requires 
ext-fileinfo * -> it 
is missing from your 
system. Install or 
enable PHP's fileinfo 
extension.

To enable extensions, 
verify that they are 
enabled in your .ini 
files:
    - 
C:\php-8.3.6\php.ini
You can also run `php 
--ini` in a terminal 
to see which files are 
used by PHP in CLI 
mode.
Alternatively, you can 
run Composer with `--ig
nore-platform-req=ext-f
ileinfo` to 
temporarily ignore 
these required 
extensions.
You can also try 
re-running composer 
require with an 
explicit version 
constraint, e.g. 
"composer require socia
liteproviders/spotify:*
" to figure out if any 
version is 
installable, or 
"composer require socia
liteproviders/spotify:^
2.1" if you know which 
you need.

Installation failed, 
reverting 
./composer.json and 
./composer.lock to 
their original content.
